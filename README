This gem is (or 'll be) designed, to make cross posts to livejournal.

At first it contains class, that allows you to access livejournal API. For example, if you want.

Next I plan to make it possible to create crossposts from you own design blog. Most possibly, using ActionView classes, for creating crossposted messages.

And step 2, I'm, thinking of making crossposter gem, that'll use cron-like and uviversal crosspost API to make crossposts to some blogs.
